# README
Just so you're aware, this is just a rough draft of what I'd like this website to look like. The only chapter that currently works is 1 Nephi 1, and on mobile I'm really not satisfied with how it looks. I'd like to have it slide over once I knew how to do that.

None of the language drop-downs really do anything, I've just hard coded in the first chapter with German on the left and English on the right.
